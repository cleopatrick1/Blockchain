Case Study -- Illuvium      

What is it?

Illuvium is a decentralized protocol that represents a new age in gaming. It has been created from the ground-up to support the long-term sustainability of the Illuvium game and governance as well as the platform, and provides players with a AAA-rated blockchain gaming experience. Illuvium is the first of its kind to bring AAA gaming to the blockchain ecosystem. What makes Illuvium special is that stakers receive regular distributions and can vote on everything from tokenomics related issues to the features in the game itself brining on a unique twist to the ecosystem. With Illuvium, the power to define the project into the future is purposefully left to those who stake in the protocol and invest into its future.

Why this Matters?

There are currently no AAA gaming titles with cinematic quality 3D special effects in an immersive open-world RPG built in DeFi, and Illuvium merges gaming and cryptocurrency in a unique synergy that holds wonder for crypto enthusiasts, dedicated gamers, and the curious tech-savvy public. By having gorgeous, functional, and rare NFTs, as well as a high replay value, Illuvium will keep players interested in the $ILV protocol longer, ensuring the stability of the underlying NFT assets and the token pool. Traditional gaming sectors will either have to adapt or be left behind in the future.


Why this may be interesting?

The last 24 months, and particularly in the last six, DeFi apps have seen impressive growth and rapid development. There are hundreds of DeFi projects gaining traction todayâ€”from trading, lending, and wallet interfaces, to assets and communities representing over 15B $USD in value. DeFi allows us to leverage this exciting growth to bootstrap a solvent platform that can hit the ground running for the increasing market interest in DeFi projects.
